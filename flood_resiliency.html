<h1><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h1>
<p>In 2014 WPWA was awarded a $720,000 grant  to develop a watershed wide management plan for flood resiliency. This project will address the problems faced by cities and towns in the Wood-Pawcatuck Watershed  caused by extreme weather events. The Hurricane Sandy Coastal Resiliency Competitive Grant Program supports   projects, such as this, that reduce communities&rsquo; vulnerability to the growing risks from   coastal storms, sea level rise, flooding, erosion and associated threats through   strengthening natural ecosystems that also benefit fish and wildlife. The   program, funded by the Hurricane Sandy disaster relief appropriation through the   Department of the Interior (DOI), is administered by NFWF. 	The two year project is expected to be completed in early 2017.</p>
  <p>The Pawcatuck Watershed Management Plan will be researched and drafted by the engineering firm of Fuss and O'Neil, who have previously designed fish passage projects on the Pawcatuck River. The project will involve assessment of existing conditions and evaluation of what can be done to avoid or midigate future impacts from catastrophic storms. Meetings with all the watershed communities and interested stakeholders will be held before, during, and after the plan is drafted. This project will provide a management plan which includes a list of actions and tools that cities and towns can use to protect themselves from future weather related events. The RI Department of Environmental Management will work closely with WPWA to see that the management plan meets the needs of the watershed. The goal of the project is to have a finished product that RIDEM and local communities can adopt and begin using immediately. </p>

  <h2><a name="PandB"></a>Problem and Background</h2>
<p>The Pawcatuck River has suffered  extensive flooding, and flood related damages most   extensively by super storm Sandy and the historic <a href="http://www.wpwa.org/gallery.php?parentID=30">March 2010 Flood</a>. Significant flood damage has occurred in both Connecticut and Rhode  Island. Water management both from a quantity and quality perspective is an  important consideration for the Pawcatuck River Watershed.  The Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) has  performed a Reconnaissance Study to evaluate the nature of the flooding, the  magnitude of the flood damage, and measures that may exist to mitigate this  damage. A follow-up ACOE feasibility study is being funded through a grant from  Hurricane Sandy relief funds.The  RI Nature Conservancy also received a Hurricane Sandy Coastal Resiliency Grant  to reduce Pawcatuck River flooding impacts and improve fish passage through the  removal of the White Rock Dam in 2015.&nbsp; National Oceanographic Atmospheric Agency  (NOAA) and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) have invested  significant funds in the removal of a dam and the restoration of fish passage  at several other dams in the upper Pawcatuck River. In addition several studies  relating to water supply and water quality have been funded by the State of  Rhode Island. The federal and state governments have recognized the Pawcatuck  River and its watershed as a highly valuable watershed worth preserving and  protecting and are expending a substantial sum of money on this watershed. This project will complement those projects and further identify opportunities  to protect and enhance natural resources, but with a focus on reducing vulnerability  to future storm relates damages. </p>
<p><img src="images/gallery/Woodville_Road_Wood_River.jpg" width="600" height="450"></p>
    <h2><a name="HSCRGrantProg"></a>Hurricane Sandy Coastal Resiliency  Grant Program </h2>
    <p> WPWA will utilize the grant to develop a comprehensive flood and  storm damage resiliency and watershed management plan that will focus on  stormwater and flood management in a way that mitigates future flooding  concerns from existing and proposed new land use, but also provides the benefit  of protecting water quality and aquatic habitat. The project will evaluate a variety of alternatives to determine which are most cost effective, inclugint mitigation measures that are beyond the scope and focus  of the Army Corps Flood Protection Feasibility study. This can be accomplished  in a variety of ways that will be evaluated.  Objectives of the project will be to  provide tools to the community that can help them develop greater resiliency to  impacts of future storms and climate change including resistance to greater  precipitation events resulting in larger flood events, more severe hurricanes  and tropical storms resulting in greater occurrence of inland flooding, dam  failure, stream and river erosion, and channel restricting sedimentation  events. These tools will be developed in such a way that community resiliency  can be strengthened by enhancement of natural systems. The community includes  the property owners, land developers and Local and State governments.  The watershed planning document will  provide the following: </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="inline">Identification of known flooding/erosion/sedimentation  problems in the watershed, building on the FEMA Flood Insurance Studies and the  work that the Army Corps has already done for the larger urban flooding areas  of Westerly and focusing on the stormwater management in the upper watershed.  The Corps states in their reconnaissance report that stormwater management is a  critical component in the success of flood management in the watershed.</li>
      <li class="inline">Identification of all dams in the watershed and a  preliminary feasibility assessment of the potential for their removal to  eliminate the risk of failure during future storms and the subsequent damages resulting.  This would complement the work being done by the USFWS on the removal of the  White Rock Dam, and the WPWA on the removal of a dam on the upper Pawcatuck  River.</li>
      <li class="inline">Identification of hydraulic structures in the watershed,  including bridges and culverts, and an assessment of their flood conveyance  capacity and the potential flooding or road damage that they cause if they are  undersized. Identification of improvement alternatives including increased culvert  sizes, to mitigate flooding and erosion damages. This evaluation would also include  the assessment of aquatic connectivity. The culverts or bridges that are both undersized  and restricting hydraulic connectivity are an intersection of two issues that can  be addressed simultaneously with the same action and would provide a natural systems  enhancement while strengthening community resiliency.</li>
      <li class="inline">Identification of opportunities for Green infrastructure in  the upland to reduce stormwater runoff flows to mitigate current flood flows  and to guide development in a manner that does not increase the current  hydrologic response of the watershed in flow peaks, duration and volume of  flood flows.</li>
      <li class="inline">Identification of areas where sediment removal could result  in greater flood conveyance capacity and/or flood storage resulting in reduced  flood elevations and/or peak flows.</li>
      <li class="inline">Fluvial geomorphological assessment of the stream and river  systems in the watershed, to identify the classification of the watercourses  and the likelihood that the stream channels will migrate over time due to  natural channel processes, increased flow from the watershed, or man-made  modifications to the hydraulic system. Over time, streams meander laterally,  and fill or degrade vertically as they adjust to their water levels, sediments,  and slope. Stream channels may change suddenly and catastrophically. The area  of active stream channel movement is called the Fluvial Erosion Hazard Zone.  Identification of the Fluvial Hazard Zones in the watershed would provide  valuable information to land owners and the Town to allow for planning of more  resilient land use in the future.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>The watershed management plan will  provide tools to plan wisely for land use initiatives in the watershed  including development and redevelopment activities. It will be written for implementation  by the private sector in selecting lands that are free of specific hazards or  that are valuable to be developed in a specific way that would minimize hazard  potential and enhance resiliency. Similarly some land may be so sensitive as to  be deemed good candidates for preservation by the community and a plan for  acquisition can be developed with the property owner. This plan will be written  as well for use by municipalities as zoning, regional growth nodes, open space  preservation, and at Statewide Planning for land-use management initiatives.</p>
<p>The success of this watershed  management planning effort is dependent upon the development of a plan that  reflects the consensus of the watershed Towns and landowners. The only way that  this can be accomplished is through a well-facilitated process where  information is shared throughout the development of the plan and interested  parties are given ample opportunities to be informed, to ask questions and to  contribute to the process. The objective at the completion of the management  plan development is to have a plan that reflects the consensus of the Towns and  whose recommendations are logical and clearly outlined as to how they can be implemented.  &nbsp;WPWA has a track record of working  cooperatively and respectfully with land owners and the communities within the  watershed.</p>
