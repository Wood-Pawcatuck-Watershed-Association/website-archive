  <p><font size="+1"><b>Introduction: </b></font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"> Volunteer monitoring of community lakes, rivers, and streams 

    has taken on greater importance over the last decade. Budget and personnel 

    limitations on local, state, and federal agencies have left large gaps in 

    data collection, particularly on minor water bodies. Volunteers have been 

    shown to be willing and capable of adequate data collection, particularly 

    on water bodies in which they have a personal interest. Data collected by 

    volunteers have increasingly provided useful information to decision makers 

    regarding water quality over the past decade. <br>

    <a href="http://www.uri.edu/ce/wq/ww/html/ww.html">URI Watershed Watch</a>, 

    founded in 1987 with advisors and volunteers from WPWA, has used volunteers 

    to monitor lakes, ponds, and large rivers throughout Rhode Island and southeastern 

    Connecticut. Since 1990, monitors in the Pawcatuck Watershed have had the 

    option of conducting tributary water sampling in conjunction with their lake 

    monitoring. Several volunteers have participated in this supplemental monitoring, 

    documenting great variation in stream water quality. The 1998 project was 

    started because it was clear that a systematic collection of data over a period 

    of years could provide baseline data on stream systems, and perhaps highlight 

    differences between natural variations and those caused by anthropogenic events. 

    The 1998 project indicated that, although there were limitations, properly-trained 

    and supported volunteers could provide useful stream flow information.</font></p>



  <p><font size="+1"><br>

    <b>Monitoring Sites and Methodology:</b></font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Members of the technical steering committee met to select 

    sites and discuss the methodology of data collection. The committee included 

    representatives from federal agencies, URI WW, and various local stakeholder 

    groups. Results from the 1998 project were reported to the committee for review.<br>

    Several decisions were made regarding the ongoing effort in 1999. The first 

    was to continue dry weather monitoring during the growing season because these 

    data could address concerns related to irrigation impacts on stream flow. 

    The second was to continue monitoring the eight sites from 1998: five on the 

    Beaver River (Richmond, RI) and three on the Green Falls River (North Stonington, 

    CT). Third, the committee decided to add seven new monitoring sites: three 

    on the Meadow Brook (Richmond, RI), and four in the Queens River watershed 

    (Exeter and South Kingstown, RI). Meadow Brook was selected to expand efforts 

    of student groups currently sampling the stream. The four streams in the Queens 

    were selected because the USGS, under contract with the Pawcatuck Watershed 

    Partnership (PWP) Water Use Stakeholder Group, was in the midst of a two-year 

    water use study in that watershed. <br>

    For the continuing program in the year 2000, the committee decided to add 

    five more sites in the Locustville Pond watershed, at the request of the Hopkinton 

    Conservation Commission, and two additional sites in the Queens watershed 

    (only one of those sites was actually monitored in 2000.) The Locustville 

    Pond sites were added in response to concerns about changes in water quality 

    due to several very large subdivisions under construction, and others that 

    were proposed for construction in the near future. <br>

    Volunteers were available for most of the sites (see Tables 1 and 2), with 

    many returning for the second year. WPWA interns monitored sites that did 

    not have volunteers. </font></p>



  <p></p>

  <p><b><font size="+1">Volunteer Recruitment and Training:</font></b><font size="+1"> 

    </font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">T</font><font size="+1">he manual for this program, entitled 

    Volunteer Monitoring of Streams in the Pawcatuck Watershed, was developed 

    in 1998, using the URI WW publication Advanced Training for Water Quality 

    Volunteers: Stream Monitoring, and the USEPA publication <a href="http://www.epa.gov/volunteer/stream/">Volunteer 

    Stream Monitoring: A Methods Manual</a>. <br>

    Volunteer monitors from WPWA, NSCLS, and area schools participated in classroom 

    sessions and field workshops developed by URI WW. URI WW and WPWA jointly 

    conducted the field training, with assistance from members of the <a href="http://users.ids.net/%7Enctu/">Narragansett 

    Chapter of Trout Unlimited</a>. Monitors who were unable to attend training 

    classes were field trained and instructed by WPWA.<br>



    Students and teachers from two schools, Chariho Middle School and Richmond 

    Elementary School, also conducted monitoring on Meadow Brook. Special training 

    classes were conducted by WPWA at the schools, along with classes on water 

    quality and habitat assessments. Teachers used the stream monitoring as part 

    of their science curriculums. Funding for the school participation was provided 

    by a $1,280 grant from Captain Planet and a $1,000 grant from the RI State 

    Senate.<br>

    Volunteers collected temperature data and dissolved oxygen levels on a weekly 

    or biweekly basis. At the same time they read and recorded the level of in-stream 

    staff gauges, which were installed at allocations by the interns. Some of 

    the difficulties encountered included getting gauges installed at several 

    of the sites, having gauges removed by vandals, or by road construction crews 

    working near the sites. These, and other simpler setbacks, have resulted in 

    insufficient data points at some of the sties to produce acceptable stage/discharge 

    relationship curves for those sites. <br>

    Approximately once per month from May to October, volunteers collected water 

    samples for bacteria, total phosphorus, dissolved phosphorus, chloride, total 

    nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, and pH analysis, performed at 

    URI WW laboratory using US EPA approved procedures. Volunteers collected water 

    samples on approximately a monthly basis for analysis in the URI WW laboratory. 

    The results are listed in Tables 3 through 14. Dissolved oxygen and temperature 

    results are listed in Graphs 1 through 13. Elevated bacteria levels were most 

    often associated with rain events, some of which were not uniform throughout 

    the sub-watersheds. Nutrient fluctuations were evident, but further monitoring 

    will be necessary to identify a trend. Continued monitoring of water quality 

    conditions will also be necessary to establish baseline conditions.<br>

    The North Stonington Citizen Land Alliance (NSCLA) provided volunteers and 

    funding for all water quality analysis on the Green Falls River sites. The 

    Hopkinton Conservation Commission and the Locustville Pond Association each 

    provided some funding for water quality analysis of sites within the Locustville 

    Pond watershed.<br>

    One of the lessons learned from 1998 was that stream flow measurements were 

    sometimes beyond the training level of project volunteers, and therefore an 

    important change in 1999 was the hiring of interns during the summer who were 

    trained to obtain flow measurements at each of the monitored sites. The goal 

    was to get enough data points to produce a stage/discharge curve at each site 

    that would fall within acceptable confidence levels. Undergraduate student 

    interns from URI Natural Resources Science were recruited by WPWA and trained 

    jointly by URIWW, WPWA, and USGS, to perform stream flow measurements at the 

    sampling sites using a <a href="http://www.rickly.com/pygmy_mh_magnetic_head.htm">Rickly 

    Hydrological Company pygmy current meter</a> (Columbus, Ohio) . Two interns 

    were hired in 1999; one in 2000. Funds from the PRP grant covered the cost 

    of intern salaries. The current meter was purchased with the PRP grant, and 

    upon the recommendation of a USGS representative on the technical steering 

    committee. Each site was to be measured during several different flow stages 

    by the WPWA interns. </font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><b>Precipitation Data:</b></font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">The summer of 1999 was an unusually dry summer, following 

    a fairly dry year in 1998. The average monthly rainfall, as recorded at the 

    Kingston Weather Station, in June was 0.05 inches, in July was 1.06 inches, 

    and in August was 2.94 inches. In contrast the same months in the summer 2000 

    recorded 5.85 inches, 4.45 inches, and 4.85 inches. The total annual rainfall 

    for 1999 was 29.23 inches and for 2000 was 39.65 inches.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><br>



    <b>Monitoring Site Discussion:</b></font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><b>Beaver River</b></font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"> Beaver River is a relatively undeveloped watershed. Most 

    of the upper half of the stream is in the DeCopett Estate, which includes 

    2000 acres of recently regenerated forests and some farm fields. South of 

    Rt. 138 the watershed consists mainly of agricultural fields and scattered 

    single family homes. There have been a few recent subdivisions built in the 

    watershed. A golf course was recently built on the western edge, adjacent 

    to Rhode Island Nature Conservancy holdings in Richmond. The Nature Conservancy 

    (TNC) had some concerns over possible nutrient enrichment of the Beaver River 

    as result of maintenance practices for the golf course.<br>

    Monitoring sites were altered slightly because of some confusion in 1998 over 

    exactly where site #4 was. Therefore, flow measurements in 1999 and 2000 were 

    done at site #4B, Shannock Hill Road, while samples were taken from site #4A, 

    School House Road, and site #4B in 1999; and taken only at site #4B in 2000. 

    The bridge at site #2 was rebuilt in the Spring and Summer of 2000. It was 

    not possible to reinstall the stream gauge during that time and no flow measurements 

    could be done. Nutrient sampling and DO measurements were continued. The stream 

    bed at site #5 is mostly a braided stream and wetland complex, making it unsuitable 

    for proper flow measurements. Therefore no stage/discharge curve was developed 

    for this site. The volunteer at this site discontinued sampling for 2000.<br>

    Bacteria levels were relatively high in 1999, a dry summer. They were below 

    EPA standards for 2000, except for a spike at site #5. There are several possible 

    explanations for this spike. The site is just below several agricultural fields, 

    and the cause could be wildlife frequenting the fields towards the end of 

    summer. There is also a dairy farm to the east, although some distance away. 

    It could also have been due to a recent rain event that created enough overflow 

    to carry some of the manure into the stream. <br>

    Nitrate levels were also relatively high in the lower sites of the sub-basin, 

    particularly in 1999. This trend was continued at sites 4 &amp; 5, particularly 

    towards the end of summer. Elevated nitrate levels could be the result of 

    agricultural practices in the area. Phosphorus and chloride were present, 

    but not significant, and the pH was somewhat acidic, averaging within normal

  <p><font size="+1"> The Meadow Brook begins north of Rt. 138 in Richmond from 

    wetlands, including wet meadows that are also used as grazing pastures for 

    a dairy farm. It continues south of Rt. 138 through a completely denuded area 

    of a golf course before draining the greater part of the Carolina Management 

    Area. It then runs through a forested buffer that is surrounded by turf fields 

    before emptying into the Meadowbrook Pond. <br>

    The pond has been monitored routinely since 1988 by WPWA. Its water quality 

    has fluctuated over this period, but it is generally classified as <a href="http://www.dragonflyireland.fsnet.co.uk/glossary.htm">mesotrophic</a>. 

    <br>

    Because Meadow Brook is in close proximity to two schools, it was monitored 

    as much for the educational value as well as information data. The area near 

    Rt. 138 tends to dry up completely during mid to late summer. It then flows 

    intermittently with sufficient rain events until late fall when it tends to 

    flow until the following summer. <br>

    The first site, behind Richmond elementary school, is slightly impounded, 

    allowing sufficient water to support aquatic insects. Although a stream gauge 

    was installed at this location with permission from the Richmond Town Council, 

    flow measurements were not consistent due to the installation of wire netting 

    near the impoundment. Its apparent purpose was to hold fish for a youth fishing 

    derby sponsored by the town. Measurements were taken below the impoundment 

    but they are not deemed accurate. At the second site flow measurements were 

    only taken in 1999 because the stream gauge was apparently removed before 

    the 2000 monitoring season. <br>



    Nutrients were relatively low, with a moderately high nitrate readings for 

    mid-summer in both years. Total phosphorus and chlorides were low or not present. 

    As is typical, the stream tended to be just slightly acidic. Bacteria was 

    a big concern both years at site #1, most likely due to ducks and geese that 

    frequent the little impoundment. <br>

    The relatively low nutrient readings at site #3 may indicate that there is 

    little or no nutrient loading from the turf fields nearby. It may also mean 

    that any excessive nutrient problems in Meadowbrook Pond come from sources 

    of contamination directly adjacent to the pond. It is recommended that consideration 

    be given to these issues in future monitoring studies.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><b>Green Falls River</b></font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"> The Green Falls sub-basin is almost entirely within Connecticut. 

    The northern end of the basin starts in Voluntown, where feeder streams in 

    the Pachaug State Forest empty into Green Falls Pond. This is an impounded 

    area, used now primarily for recreational purposes. The Green Falls River 

    begins at the dam and flows through more of the Pachaug State Forest until 

    it enters North Stonington. From there the land use becomes mostly agricultural. 

    It flows into a wetland complex and then into the Ashaway River near the border 

    of RI and CT, adjacent to Rt. 95. The North Stonington Citizen Land Alliance, 

    which sponsored the three sites on this river, was concerned about the possible 

    impacts from agricultural practices.<br>

    Bacterial counts tended to be high during the summer of 1999, particularly 

    at site #3. In 2000, sites #1 &amp; 2 did not exceed EPA standards for recreational 

    contact. Site #3 did exceed the standards consistently throughout the summer, 

    with the highest levels in May. <br>



    Phosphorus levels were low throughout both years, as was ammonia-nitrogen. 

    Nitrates, however were relatively high at site #3, with a spike that went 

    off the scale in July 1999. Chlorides remained low both years and pH was normal 

    for northeastern streams.<br>

    The higher bacteria and nitrate counts at site #3 could be an indication of 

    nutrient loading from the dairy farm to the north of the site. Further investigation 

    into these issues is recommended for future monitoring studies.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><b>Queens River Watershed</b></font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"> The Queens River runs through a variety of land uses and 

    includes habitats that support several species of concern. This watershed 

    is primarily forest and agricultural land, with an historic village and mill 

    along an impoundment near the southern part. There is increased development 

    pressure here and elsewhere in the Pawcatuck watershed. There is also potential 

    for an industrial or large residential complex at the site of the former Ladd 

    center.<br>

    The PWP Water Use Stakeholder Group selected the Queens River sub-basin for 

    a pilot assessment of existing water use and habitat needs in 1998. In 1999 

    and 2000, the USGS collected data to be used in a hydrological model to determine 

    how much water is in the Queens River watershed, amounts needed to meet current 

    needs, and possible effects of future land use changes. They also conducted 

    habitat assessments on several of the secondary and tertiary streams as well 

    as the Queens River to determine the possible impacts of instantaneous flow 

    fluctuations on the aquatic ecosystem. Three of the sites for the WPWA study 

    were selected to coincide with sites already being used by USGS.<br>

    Four sites were established late in the summer of 1999. Site #1, Sherman Brook, 

    is a small primary brook that occasionally stops flowing during very dry years. 

    Gardner road, which runs parallel to the west, has been developed into parts 

    of the small watershed. Site #2, Locke Brook, is also a primary stream that 

    maintains a good flow throughout the year. There is a small reservoir impounded 

    near the beginning of the stream to the north. It is considered one of the 

    best habitats for native brook trout. Site #3, Fisherville Brook, is a secondary 

    stream that flows primarily through forested areas. Audubon Society of Rhode 

    Island has property on the northern section of this watershed. Site #4, Queens 

    River, is on the property of Peter Brownell, who also volunteered to collect 

    data. It is in the upper third of the watershed, downstream of the Exeter 

    Country Club golf course, and north of the former Ladd Center. In 2000, a 

    fifth site was added on the Queens at Mail Road. This site is downstream of 

    the Ladd Center.<br>



    Bacteria counts were low at all of the sites except site #5, which was above 

    EPA standards in August and September 2000. This site is used as a swimming 

    hole, which may have contributed to the higher count. Total phosphorus and 

    ammonia-nitrogen was low for all sites in both years. Nitrates were high at 

    site #4, Queens River on the Brownell property, in July of 2000. This may 

    be due to heavy rains in late June and early July washing nutrients downstream 

    from the golf course. Chloride levels were low at all sites. All the sites 

    tended to be slightly acidic. Site #1 showed the most acidity with 6 readings 

    out of 9 over the two-year period below a pH of 6.0.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><br>

    <b>Locustville Watershed</b></font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"> The Locustville Pond Association and the Hopkinton Conservation 

    Commission requested that WPWA add some of the streams that drained into the 

    Locustville Pond in Hopkinton to the list of monitoring sites for 2000. This 

    area of the town has large tracts of undeveloped land of mostly second growth 

    forests and farms. There are several large developments being proposed in 

    the western part of the Locustville watershed, upstream of the pond. These 

    developments include hundreds of housing units (condominiums as well as single- 

    family homes.) One development, which is nearing final approval, will include 

    a golf course that will in part drain into Brushy Brook.<br>

    The same volunteer who regularly monitored Locustville Pond had monitored 

    two sites on Sawmill Road occasionally in the past. Both of these sites, where 

    the road crosses Brushy Brook and Moscow Brook, will be just downstream from 

    two of the developments. Another site, where Brushy Brook crosses Woody Hill 

    Road, was selected because it is just upstream of the one of the proposed 

    developments. However, just above and below this site Brushy Brook crosses 

    through a pasture field for cows, and may receive heavy influence from that 

    land use. Another site, Dawley Brook, which is unnamed on the USGS topographical 

    map, was selected because it drains from the Arcadia Management Area. It may 

    represent a relatively unimpacted stream. A fifth site, Loghouse Brook where 

    it crosses Grassy Pond Road, was selected because it is upstream of one of 

    the other proposed developments. There are concerns about this site also, 

    because it is immediately downstream of a swamp. Dissolved Oxygen levels are 

    very low, and may be due to anoxic conditions normally present in the swamp. 

    The only stream gauges are at the two sites on Sawmill Road. Plans for 2001 

    include installation of gauges on Grassy Pond Road for Loghouse Brook, and 

    on Woody Hill Road for Brushy Brook. <br>

    Bacteria count was high for site #1, Brushy Brook at Sawmill, for July, August 

    and September. It is downstream from site #2, which only had one recorded 

    high reading in August. Monitoring for that site had just been started. In 

    contrast, site #3, Moscow Brook, which is less than 1000 feet from site #1, 

    showed low bacteria counts all summer and was still just below EPA standards 

    in September. The high bacteria counts at site #1 may be attributed to the 

    presence of small horse farms and a small dairy farm upstream. Nitrates also 

    tended to be higher at site #1, with very little or none detected at the other 

    sites. Ammonia-nitrogen, total phosphorus, and chlorides were low or not detected 

    at all of the sites. The pH readings fluctuated at all the sites, with the 

    lowest readings in September. Site #1 had a reading of 4.8, site #2 read 4.6 

    and site #3 read 5.7. Only two readings were done at site #5 in August and 

    September but they both showed the site to be very acidic. The anoxic conditions 

    in the swamp just upstream may be the biggest contributing factor to the acidity 

    of the site. Dissolved oxygen levels at all the sites remained within acceptable 

    standards for trout habitat.</font></p>



  <p><b><font size="+1">Implications</font></b></p>

  <p><font size="+1"> This two-year project demonstrated that volunteer monitoring 

    programs could successfully provide much needed stream data to augment professionally 

    collected data. It is important to maintain staff support in the form of actual 

    flow measurements. It is better to have volunteers monitor stream height, 

    rather than stream flow. It is also helpful to provide backup for the volunteers 

    if they are unable to collect water samples on the designated days. The staff 

    gauges can continue to be read by volunteers on a regular basis to determine 

    changes in stream levels. Once a stage/discharge relationship has been established 

    it will require routine re-calibration to ensure accuracy of the measurements. 

    Re-calibration includes assessing the site to ensure that the stream channel 

    has not been significantly altered, measuring stream flow, and re-calculating 

    the stage-discharge relationship. WPWA found it important to this project 

    to have a seasonal intern to regularly check all the sites, perform flow measurements, 

    and to collect water samples when needed.<br>

    Most of the data collected over the course of this projects suggests that, 

    other than irregular spikes in bacteria and nitrates, there are relatively 

    few major implications of high impacts on the streams monitored. High bacteria 

    counts can usually be traced to wildlife use of the area, agricultural practices, 

    or human use. Nitrate levels need to be followed more carefully. However, 

    because of increased development on all the subwatersheds monitored in this 

    project, indications of impact are likely in the future. WPWA will continue 

    to monitor the same sites for 2001 in order to establish baseline data and 

    refine techniques.<br>

    Recommended planning for the next two to five years should include consideration 

    of developing a strategic monitoring plan for surface waters in its watershed 

    area. Beyond the collection of baseline data, and strategically implemented 

    to coincide with potentially harmful toxic events or land use practices, such 

    monitoring activity will contribute to a better understanding of rapidly changing 

    water quality indicators and will suggest means for sustaining existing pristine 

    areas as well as improving impacted portions of the watershed. A strategic 

    monitoring effort is a logical next step in this project. The benefits as 

    well as limitations of the results of these initial studies may be used in 

    the further development and application of a strategic monitoring plan. The 

    sampling design for strategic monitoring could emphasize sampling sites above 

    and below major perceived sources of contamination. Transient water quality 

    sampling will also be undertaken in the field using automatic data loggers. 

    Parameters measured by the data loggers will include conductance, water temperature, 

    pH and dissolved oxygen. <br>

    It is generally known that population growth and land use changes often may 

    result in the degradation of water quality. The Pawcatuck Watershed, consisting 

    of more than 190,000 acres, has experienced up to 35% growth in some of its 

    rural towns, and roughly 20% growth overall, according to 2000 census figures. 

    Increased development activity including residential housing, commercial development, 

    and several new golf courses have strengthened the argument that water demand, 

    water use, and water quality must be addressed with regard to preservation 

    of water supplies. Moreover, a better understanding is needed of the effects 

    of multiple land uses on water quality when they are addressed on a watershed 

    scale. Our strategic monitoring activities will consider the entire watershed 

    area as well as the many factors, which may influence water quality.<br>
